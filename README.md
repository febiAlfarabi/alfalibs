### Adding Dependency
* To use this library, put it in your application build.gradle

```java
 repositories {

    }
 }
```
```java

- Fragment and Activity navigation helped by @rebus007 library
- Navigation Slider View, helped by @vikramkakkar
- Project Lombok

- WLog, for logging your apps created by me, with control mode whether is Development or Production mode to disable Logging after release
- Usable Adapter Collection by me (Explanation Later)
